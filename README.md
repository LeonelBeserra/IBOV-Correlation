This study proposes to analyze the correlation between IBOV's stocks.
IBOV index is the main index in the brazilian stock market. It's composed of 
82 stocks.
First of all, let's briefly clarify what is correlation:

Correlation shows the strength of a relationship between two variables and is 
expressed numerically by the correlation coefficient. The correlation 
coefficient's values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A perfect positive correlation
means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. This implies that as one
security moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the
same direction. A perfect negative correlation means that two assets move in 
opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no linear relationship at all.

Important: Correlation does not imply causation!

Correlation measures association, but doesn't show if x causes y or vice versa, 
or if the association is caused by a third–perhaps unseen–factor.


Correlation in stock market
The correlation coefficient is measured on a scale from -1 to 1. A correlation
coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation between the prices of
two stocks, meaning the stocks always move the same direction by the same amount. 
A coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that the
stocks have historically always moved in the opposite direction. If two stocks 
have a correlation coefficient of 0, it means there is no correlation and, 
therefore, no relationship between the stocks. It is unusual to have either a
perfect positive or negative correlation.

Investors can use the correlation coefficient to select assets with negative
correlations for inclusion in their portfolios, long/short operations and 
predictions, etc. The calculation of the correlation coefficient takes the covariance 
of the two variables in question and each variable's standard deviation.

While standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of data from its average,
covariance is a measure of how two variables change together. By dividing 
covariance by the product of the two standard deviations, one can calculate the
correlation coefficient and determine to what extent assets in a portfolio are
likely to move in tandem.
